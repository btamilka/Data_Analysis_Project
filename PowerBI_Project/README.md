## Project description
I analysed (visaulisation) the performance of different sales managers, agents, products, and markets.

## Data souce: B2B sales pipeline data: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground

### Key Metrics
The performance of the sales team is measured using the following key metrics:
- **Revenue**: Total sales revenue generated.
- **Deals Won**: Number of successful deals.
- **Deals Lost**: Number of deals that did not result in a sale.
- **Prospecting Deals**: Number of deals currently in the prospecting stage.

## Visualistion/dashboard
The relationships between these key metrics are visualized using various types of charts and tables to provide a clear and insightful representation of the data:

1. **Clustered bar and donut Charts/managers**:
   **Sales Performance by Managers**: Visualizes the revenue and deal counts attributed to each sales manager, facilitating a comparison of performance.

2. **Stacked column and clustered bar charts/regional block**:
   Visualises the the revenue and deals for each regional block (EAST, WEST, and CENTRAL).
  
3. **Table/sales agents**:
**Deal stage distribution for sales agents**: Illustrates the proportion of deals negotiated by sales agents (won, lost, prospecting), providing a quick comaprison of the performance of sales agents.

4. **Donut chart/total revenue**:
   Displays the revenue generated by different products, helping to identify top-performing and underperforming products.

5. **Slicer/product**:
   A slicer (product) is added for facilitate the comparison of key metrics/relationships by products.
